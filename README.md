# Search Algorithm and Application
**What is search?**
> In computer science, a search algorithm is an algorithm designed to solve a search problem.

## About this repo
This repo is where I implement search algorithms in Python.
The implementation of these algorithms is then applied to real world scenarios ranging from maze solver, subway routing, to Six degrees of separation theory.

**Search Algorithm**
> - [x] BFS
> - [x] DFS
> - [ ] Astar

**Application**
> - [x] Maze solver
> - [x] Subway routing
> - [x] Six degrees of separation
> - [ ] Tictactoe
